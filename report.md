## Linked data approach

'Linked Data' is the name given to a standards-based approach to representing and disseminating data using the World Wide Web.  The [principles of Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) were first documented by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006.  The four guiding principles of Linked Data are:

* Use URIs as names for things.
* Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
* When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards
* Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.

exploiting the web, identifiers - for entities of interest and for properties/classes/concepts to describe the structure and meaning of data

global identifiers that make use of the mechanisms of the web to look up information about them - and so let one piece of data easily link to another

this supports integration of data from different sources by making connections between them

the process of standardisation still needs different people to agree on ways of identifying and describing their data, but this provides a mechanism for the connections
