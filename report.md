## Linked data approach

'Linked Data' is the name given to a standards-based approach to representing and disseminating data using the World Wide Web.  The [principles of Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) were first documented by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006.  The four guiding principles of Linked Data are:

* Use URIs as names for things.
* Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
* When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards
* Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.
